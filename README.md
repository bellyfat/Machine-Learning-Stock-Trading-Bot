# Machine-Learning-Stock-Trading-Bot
Objective: 
Day trading bots are ubiquitous projects. 
Swing trading bots are not as common, especially one that performs both fundamental and technical trading methodology with machine learning implementation. I wanted to automate my hobby of swing trading. Staying true to its swing trading objective, the program is only designed to execute selling and buying once per day. 

Mechanics: 
--> Implements sentiment analysis on equity related "tweets" to identify optimistically trending stocks
--> Performs data collecting and scrubbing of 3 months worth of price history, press release, sentiment polarity, and subjectivity data
--> Predicts and calculates target price through machine learning random forest model for the next 20 business days  

a.) config.py -- Storage of all api keys: ALPHA VANTAGE, NEWSAPI, ALPACA

b.) forecast_library.py -- Data scrubbing and machine learning function
  
  1. def importing_twitdata(id1, id2) 
      --> Imports stocktwit data from 2 different automated accounts that posts daily trending stocks 
      --> Data is scrubbed by deleting twits that does not literally contain the ticker symbol of a stock
  
  2. def twit_sentiment_analyzer(raw_data) 
      --> Uses TextBlob to determine the twits sentiment on particular stocks
      --> Disregards any twit with polarity lower than 0.4 (Polarity ranges from (negative) -1 to 1 (positive))
      
  3. def pulling_price_history(ticker)
      --> Pulls the latest 3 months data of stock price history from alphavantage and puts into a DataFrame
      --> Supplements DataFrame by adding press release dates and news sentimentality and subjectivity to the DataFrame 
      --> NewsAPI data was stored in clustered dictionary and list; thus it was hectic handpicking appropriate sections of data
      --> Format and scrub DataFrame so that it is ready for machine learning
   
  4. def random_forest_forecast(data)
      --> Chose the random forest regressor model for its powerful prediction capability on short term forecasts and limited data
      --> Lacking data (merely 3 months worth of stock price history) discouraged implementing other model (free open data was used)
      --> Random forest regressor had the highest score
      --> Train 80% of the data and test 20%
      --> Predicts the stock's price for the next 20 business days and return the maximum price multiplied by it's confidence level
         
c.) __main__.py -- Executing Trade on Alpaca (https://alpaca.markets/)
   
   1. def buy()
      --> Executes created functions in forecast_library.py in the following order:
      *** def importing_twitdata(id1, id2) 
      *** def twit_sentiment_analyzer(raw_data)
      *** For each candidate stock, the bot avoids buying stocks already in position, calculates number of shares to buy
      *** qty_desired = round(((target_price - current_price) / current_price) * buying_power)
      *** Checks if the portfolio can afford to make an order
      *** Store buy history and target prices in a text file.
          
   2. def sell()
       --> If position has more than -7.5% loss or Unrealized Gain > Target Price, the bot orders an immediate sell order on market price
       --> Else, the bot pushes stop/limit order: 
           limit order = newly updated target price  
           stop limit = -7.5% of purchased price
